How to RUN on Hefaistos:
------------------------
(try mosh to not drop connection)
- from local: 'rsync -rutP DijetHistosFill.C DijetHistosFill.h mk_DijetHistosFill.C runAllIOVs.py Hefaistos:/media/storage/dijet/'
- source /work/data/rootbinaries/root/bin/thisroot.sh [6.26.10]
  [was: source /work/data/root/bin/thisroot.sh]
- (rm *.d *.so *.pcm)
- $ make
# - root -l -b -q mk_CondFormats.C
- #define GPU in mk_DijetHistosFill.C
- Execute: `$ python runIOVs.py --IOV_list [list of IOVs]`
- - e.g. `$ python runIOVs.py --IOV_list 2022C_ZB`
- - Can also use `--IOV_list all` for all IOVs, version X can be passed with `--version v[X]`, for smaller test runs use `--max_files 10` or similar
[- nohup root -l -b -q mk_DijetHistosFill.C\(\"X\"\) > log.txt & [alternative]]
+ runtime about 10-20h for most files
[=> edit (version, IOV_list) and execute 'python renameAllIOVs.py' [not yet]]

+ tail -f log.txt [for individual files]
+ tail -n3 logs/log_*v[X].txt [for overall run status]
+ starting up takes quite a bit (~X sec) due to GetEntries() call
   => code TStopWatch to ignore this startup time, or skip GetEntries

How to ANALYZE locally:
-----------------------
Copy files locally for further processing
- rsync -rutP Hefaistos:/media/storage/dijet/rootfiles/*v[X].root rootfiles/

Hadd files together as needed (either JetMET+ZB, or parts of IOV)
- python addAllIOVs.py

After producing the jmenano_[data,mc]_out_v[X].root root files and hadding: 
- root -l -b -q DijetHistosCombine.C+g   [merge triggers]
- root -l -b -q DijetHistosJER.C+g       [JER SF]
- root -l -b -q DijetHistosL2Res.C+g     [dijet L2Res]
- root -l -b -q DijetHistosOverlay.C+g   [draw dijet L2Res]

Multijet plotting
- root -l -b -q minitools/drawMultijet.C+g [draw multijet pTbin+MPF/DB]

Jet veto maps in jecsys3 package:
- root -l -b -q jecsys3/minitools/doJetVetoV2.C
- root -l -b -q jecsys3/minitools/drawJetVetoV2.C


To-do:
- add trigger turn-on folder
- add MET filters => done: Flag_METFilter; also need others?
- multijet: improve high pT efficiency (relative jet veto around leading jet?)
  - also figure out O(5-10%) mpfu even at highest pT
- add smeared collection of jets for MC => done
- option: add monitoring of <rho> for each analysis? => add to PFComposition
- check JetID and METFilters => done?
- figure out segfault for 2018D. Could be array overflow?
- update to Summer20 L1+L2L3 when available

To-do Run3:
- update JEC
- fix multijet Crecoil and PF composition
- update JER SF
- then re-update JER SF pT-dep
- check MET filters


From Fikri, 31 March 2023:
I don't thinkFlag_METFilters is defined at Nano production level. Its defined at Mini production level [1]
As for Jet_jetId, JMENanoV9 uses the same release as the central NanoAODv9, which is 10_6_26. The jetId decisions should follow the recommendations [2] .

[2] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/JetID13TeVUL#Preliminary_Recommendations_for 

Bugs:
- mpfu in multijet large compared to mpfn. Why? => sign error
- MC genWeight seems not to be working. Why? => w was set before reading event
- Wrong MC: Summer19UL16_V7 -> Summer20UL16_V1

(To do: add 40to70 to Summer22EEMG, filter out bad files). 
(To-do: Downdload Summer23 and ReReco samples. Not yet done for ZeroBias at least)

// v35. Added new L2L3Residuals along with L2Residuals. Fixed Flag_ filter introduced in v33
// v34. L2L3Residual for Run3
// v33. Updated Run 3 MET filter flags
// v32. Update HF |eta| binning. Extend pT binning. Add L2Res for CD+EFG. E still prompt. Update 2022C_ZB and 2022D_ZB to re-reco.

// v31b,c. Processeed re-reco 2022C,D (is code already v32 for |eta| binning?)

// v31. Update MC JECs to those used by Mikel (Summer22) and switch off L2L3Residuals. Split Summer22(EE)MGs into 2 or 4, fix 2022F JEC. (Next steps: implement pT-dependent JER SF and run with it. Figure out MPF vs DB.)
// v30. Change PuppiMET to RawPuppiMET for raw MET input. Split 2022F file list into two.
// v29: add Run3 code from Iita. Update JEC, jetvetomaps, JSON, rho branch mapping. Remove or comment out branches not in 2023 tuples. Patch Pileup_pthatmax for isMG.
// v28: add Incjet/h2pteta without pT range preselection.
// v27: Filter out corrupt files from 2018D2 and 2018MG (log files >1MB), as well as other large log files. Switch of HLT_ZeroBias for non-ZB datasets. Move input files to input_files subdirectory to clean up. Add useJERSFvsPt switch and functionality for MC.
// v26(ZB): Add UL2017*_ZB eras for Zero Bias primary data set. v26c also added rest.
// v26: Fix division by zero bug for Jet_CF[i] that made MPF0 and MPFu corrupted. Add UL2017MG files.
// v25: Improve handling of JER files. Default data set and versioning to "X" and "vX", set version in runAllIOVs.py". Split UL2018D to UL2018D1, UL2018D2 for more balanced running. Set nGenJetMax=100 (was 76 from 2016GH). Add debugFiles option to print out file names.

// v24: Add ability to run over 2016APV, 2016, 2017, 2018. Add IOV and version to output file name. Switch off smearing (to derive JER SF first). Revert to public JEC+JER versions (V7/V3*2, V6/V3, V5/V2) until new Summer20 files verified. Add runAllIOVs.py. Add automatic HT bin event counting. Add MC truth folder.
=> need MadGraph samples for UL2017

// v23: Add flat JER SF
// v22b: Add MadGraph capability (isMG).

// v22: Add extra profiles to Dijet2 for FSR studies (p2mnu, p2mnux, p2m0tc, p2m0pf etc.)

// v21: Add |pT1-pT2|/|pT1+pT2|<0.7 and allJetsGood flag for Dijet2.

// v20: Add Dijet2 for DESY-style dijet bins in eta and pT. Add jet veto maps. Add timer to estimate run time.

// v19: Fix JEC S19_V7->S20_V1 (except data L2L3Res still S19_V7). Fix MC weight. Fix bug in MPFu calculation (sign error between jX and mX=-jX). Filter Pileup_pthatmax>Generator_binvar. Add prho to PFComposition. (v19b for MC: fix HLT_MC).

// v18: Implement pT,avp and proper bisector for dijet and multijet following JME-21-001. Keep previous pT,ave and bisector as dijet and multijet axes, respectively. Raise pT of recoil jets to 30 GeV in multijet in hopes of reducing MPFu. Add PF composition for incjet, dijet, multijet. Add 15-40 GeV bins for dijet.

(Implement MC (flat, pThat binned, HT binned))
// v17: Add Jet_jetId>=4 (tightLepVeto) and Flag_METFilters>0 (all?) for multijet, dijet, inclusive jet and jet veto maps

// v16: Fix linking of fixedGridRhoFastjetAll (Rho_*) for Run 2. Modify multijet selection (drop all |eta|>2.5 jets from recoil, not just 1+2), patch pT2/pT1<0.6 to pT2/pTrecoil<0.6 (5% bias!), veto all forward jets, add Crecoil 1D+2D. Implement proper L1L2L3-RC MET for MPF. Clean file structure.

// v15: Add UL2016GH data+MC. Run time about 9h for data (77M/245M=>7.5k)? Added JetA and Rho as new inputs. Multijet still not working.

// v14: fix absetamin thresholds for mt["HLT_PFJetFwdX"] for X>=140. Add missing HLT_PFJet400 trigger. Add Jetveto/heta_pretrg for minitools/drawFwdTrigEff.C.

// v13:	invert reference axes on Multijet so that result is pTlead/pTrecoil (v12 and earlier effectively pTrecoil/pTlead). Add requirement that jet[1] and jet[2] at |eta|<2.5, plus check both for pT>30 and pT<0.7*pT[0]
// Implement also new dijetHistos2 for efficient analysis.
// RunE v12e: 5.5/fb (5.476540005), RunF v12f: 1.4/fb (1.363428299)
// RunCD: 7.6/fb (7.561991506)

// v12: Add p2chf,p2nef,p2nhf and p2chftp,p2chftp,p2nhftp to Jetveto. Update JSON file for 2022BCDEF. Add RunF to mk_*.C listing. Add multijet/h2m2a control.
=> todo: add Dijet folder with TProfile2D's vs eta and pT

// v11: Add doJetveto and Jetveto folder. Changed multijet alpha veto from
//      DELTAPHI to DELTAR (avoid bias on forward PU jets)

// v10: Add HLT_ZeroBias. Split text files to ZeroBias and JetMET.
//      Replace TrigObj with TrigObjJMEAK4. Add TH2D h2m0a and
//      hcosdphi for multijet controls
// Oct 12 full JSON: 9.705969501/fb. RunE only: 2.058990167/fb. (ABCD 7.6/fb)
// (JMENANO on eos: v2p0 4.9 TB, v2p1 6.1 TB)

// v9: Add inclusive jet and multijet folders. Add trigger counts.
// v9mc: Switch off L2L3Res

// v8: add UL2018 samples. Implement redoing JEC, add HLT JES with T&P
// data: 16:44->20:42 (3h58min). TrigObj doubling time?
// mc: ~20:42->01:15 (4h33min). TrigObj doubling time?

// v7: add PF composition vs eta and pT. Add hmjj2 and hmjj213
// data 17:15->19:20 (2h5min). mc 21:15->23:27 (2h12min, died).
